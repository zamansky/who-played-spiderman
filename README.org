* Who Played Spiderman? Answering Questions With Data assignment

* Requirements:
- Python 2 or 3
- Python libraries as specified in requirements.

* Installation
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python ./app.py

* Notes
This is a demo for a class lesson on using data to perform and answer
"who" and "when" queries. The code is very rudimentary and doesn't
always find the right answer (which is desired due to the lesson and
topic) and will probably crash now and again.
